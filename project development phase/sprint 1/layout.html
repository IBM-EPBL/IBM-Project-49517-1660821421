    <h1>Handwritten recognition system</h1>

    <p1>
      Handwritten text recognition is a technology that is much needed in this world as of today.This digit recognition system is used to
      recognize the digit from different sources like emails,bank cheque,papers,images,etc..
      Before proper implementation of this technology
       we have relied on writing texts with our own hands which can result in errors.
       Its difficult to store and access physical data with
       efficency.The project presents recognizing the hand writting digits(0_9)from the famous MINIST dataset.
      Here we will be using artificial neural networks/convolutional neural network</p1>
